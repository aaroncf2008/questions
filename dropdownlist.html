                    Still all looks pretty good! Always start out with mobile first. Make
                    sure things look good on small screens so everyone can enjoy your site
                    on whatever device.

                    Not all CSS can be used on every browser unfortunately. You can use
                    <a href="https://caniuse.com">this site</a> to check which CSS properties you
                    can or can not use on which browsers. For some properties you may have to
                    use some CSS-browser prefixes ( see the CSS file ) for some extra compatibility
                    across browsers.
